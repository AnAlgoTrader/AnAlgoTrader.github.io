                        As an Integration Architect, I was involved in connecting CRM Dynamics 2016 with several
                        applications within the financial services area. The main technologies and responsibilities that
                        I had to deal with can be summarised in:

                    <ul>
                        <li> Design of a web services layer to integrate a CRM Dynamics implementation with the

                            Organisation.</li>
                        <li> Develop the web services before described using the CRM Dynamics SDK for 2016 and the CRM
                            Web
                            API.</li>
                        <li> Design of a failure-retry policy that handles exceptions in the Integration Process.</li>
                        <li> Develop SSIS packages that allow to connect all third-party applications previously
                            described.</li>
                        <li> Design and implementation of a Test Suite that verifies all scenarios in the
                            infrastructure.</li>

                        I had the opportunity to mature various aspects of a multi role position in order to help the
                        business to achieve their goals.

                        As a Lead Developer, I implemented a mobile solution with Resco Mobile CRM and Crm dynamics 2015
                        with the aim to help contractors at Peabody with their daily jobs whilst they are on site. This
                        solution gave them full cover on their tasks using CRM Dynamics as their core platform.

                        As an ETL Developer/Data Migration Analyst I migrated various databases into CRM Dynamics 2015
                        using SSIS packages using the third-party component Kingsway soft.

                        As a Deployment Manager, I wrote a set of PowerShell Scripts in order to achieve a continued and
                        integrated deployment from a Development setup to a QA environment aiming to make available the
                        latest development and customisations to the Testing Team. The deployment was then done via
                        Visual Studio online using a deployment manager agent through a set of build pools.

                        As a CRM Dynamics Developer, I wrote various plug-ins and custom workflows in order to help
                        their system to achieve what could not be done using default customisations and business rules.

                        At the beginning of my contract I had to sit down with project managers in the company to help
                        them to understand how they could build their product to make it ready to be sold in the CRM
                        Dynamics market. Once they got used to the development cycle using Microsoft applications they
                        started to hire more contractors to get the job done, at that point I became more a sort of
                        Technical Lead making sure that the Visual Studio solution and the code they were writing follow
                        the standard and best practises for a MS CRM Dynamics project. Also, I was involved in testing
                        and approving the tasks for delivery as well as deploying to the UAT environment.
                        All tasks from my previous jobs apply here as I was making UI customisations, writing JavaScript
                        and C# custom processes like plug-ins and workflows to achieve the needs of the solution.

                        I was involved in all the stages from design to installation, covering developing and testing

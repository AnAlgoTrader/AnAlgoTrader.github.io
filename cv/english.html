                                    SmartImpact are experts in Microsoft Dynamics CRM and SharePoint with offices in
                                    London Victoria. They provide and support elegant and effective systems for small

                                    large organisations where customers or members are at the heart of their operations.
                                    (Web Site information)
                                    <br /><br /><b>Smartimpact</b> is a startup with a very young team were I was the
                                    main developer within 3 projects managers. I built for them their membership
                                    solution
                                    in MS Dynamics 2013 using the expertise I gathered from previous projects. At the
                                    beginning of my contract I had to sit down with project managers in
                                    the company to help them to understand how they could build their product to make it
                                    ready to be sold in the CRM Dynamics market. Once they got used to
                                    the development cycle using Microsoft applications they started to hire more
                                    contractors to get the job done, at that point I became more a sort of
                                    Technical Lead making sure that the Visual Studio solution and the code they were
                                    writing follow the standard and best practises for a MS CRM Dynamics
                                    project. Also I was involved in testing and approving the tasks for delivery as well
                                    as deploying to the UAT environment.
                                    All tasks from my previous jobs apply here as I was making UI customisations,
                                    writing javascript and c# custom processes like plugins and workflows to achieve the
                                    needs of the solution.

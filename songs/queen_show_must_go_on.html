    <div class="mainContent">
        Empty<div class="chord">Bm</div>spaces, what are we living for?<br/>
        Abandoned<div class="chord">Bm</div>places, I guess we know the score, <br/>
        on and on, does anybody know what we are looking for?<br/>
        Another hero, another mindless crime<br/>
        Behind the curtain, in the pantomime<br/>
        Hold the line<br/>
        Does anybody want to take it anymore?<br/>
        The show must go on<br/>
        The show must go on, yeah<br/>
        Inside my heart is breaking<br/>
        My makeup may be flaking<br/>
        But my smile, still, stays on<br/>
        Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance<br/>
        Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on<br/>
        Does anybody know what we are living for?<br/>
        I guess I'm learning<br/>
        I must be warmer now<br/>
        I'll soon be turning, round the corner now<br/>
        Outside the dawn is breaking<br/>
        But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free<br/>
        The show must go on<br/>
        The show must go on<br/>
        Inside my heart is breaking<br/>
        My makeup may be flaking<br/>
        But my smile, still, stays on<br/>
        My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies<br/>
        Fairy tales of yesterday, grow but never die<br/>
        I can fly, my friends<br/>
        The show must go on<br/>
        The show must go on<br/>
        I'll face it with a grin<br/>
        I'm never giving in<br/>
        On with the show<br/>
        I'll top the bill<br/>
        I'll overkill<br/>
        I have to find the will to carry on<br/>
        On with the show<br/>
        Show<br/>
        Show must go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on<br/>

<b>Bm</b>
Empty spaces, what are we living for?
    <b>G</b>
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
<b>Em</b>                <b>F#</b>                      <b>Em</b>
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for?
 <b>Bm</b>
Another hero, another mindless crime
    <b>G</b>
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
<b>Em</b>                     <b>F#</b>                      <b>Em</b>
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore?

         <b>Bm</b>
The show must go on
         <b>G</b>
The show must go on
<b>Em</b>
Inside my heart is breaking
<b>F#</b>
My make-up may be flaking
 <b>Em</b>          <b>Bm</b>
But my smile still stays on

  <b>C#m</b>
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
 <b>A</b>
Another heartache, another failed romance
<b>F#m</b>               <b>G#</b>                      <b>F#m</b>
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
     <b>C#m</b>
I guess I'm learning I must be warmer now
      <b>A</b>
I'll soon be turning round the corner now
<b>F#m</b>                                  <b>G#</b>                             <b>F#m</b>  <b>F#5</b>
Outside the dawn is breaking, but inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

<b>Em</b>             <b>Bm</b>
The show must go on
         <b>G</b>
The show must go on
<b>Em</b>
Inside my heart is breaking
<b>F#</b>
My make-up may be flaking
 <b>Em</b>          <b>Bm</b>     <b>Bm</b>  <b>G</b>  <b>Em</b>  <b>F#</b>  <b>Em</b>  <b>G</b>
But my smile still stays on

<b>F</b>          <b>G</b>             <b>Em</b>          <b>Am</b>
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
<b>F</b>                 <b>G</b>      <b>Em</b>            <b>Am</b>
Fairy-tales of yesterday will grow and never die
<b>A9</b>          <b>D</b>
I can fly, my friends

         <b>Bm</b>
The show must go on
         <b>G</b>
The show must go on
<b>Em</b>                  <b>F#</b>               <b>Em</b>      <b>Bm</b>    <b>G</b>
I'll face it with a grin, I'm never giving in, on with show
<b>Em</b>                           <b>F#</b>                    <b>Em</b>
I'll top the bill I'll overkill I have to find the will to cary on
On with the
<b>F#</b>            <b>Em</b>
On with the show
         <b>Bm</b>
The show must go on

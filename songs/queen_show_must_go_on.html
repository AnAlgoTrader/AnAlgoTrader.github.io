    <h4>Show must go on</h4>
    <span style="white-space: pre;display:block;width:100px;">
        <span class="chords">     Bm</span>
        Empty spaces - what are we living for
        <span class="chords">          G</span>
        abandoned places - I guess we know the score
        <span class="chords">Em              F#                       Em</span>
        on and on, does anybody know what we are looking for?
        <span class="chords">        Bm</span>
        Another hero, another mindless crime
        <span class="chords">           G</span>
        behind the curtain, in the pantomime
        <span class="chords">Em                  F#                      Em</span>
        hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore?  
        
        [Chorus]
        
        <span class="chords">                 Bm                   G</span>
        The show must go on, the show must go on, yeah,
        <span class="chords">   Em</span>
        inside my heart is breaking
        <span class="chords">   F#</span>
        my make-up may be flaking
        <span class="chords">       Em                     Bm</span>
        but my smile still stays on.
         
        
        [Verse 2]
        
        <span class="chords">         C#m</span>
        Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
        <span class="chords">        A</span>
        another heartache, another failed romance
        <span class="chords">F#m             G#                       F#m</span>
        on and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
        <span class="chords">            C#m</span>
        I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now,
        <span class="chords">             A</span>
        I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
        <span class="chords">F#m</span>
        outside the dawn is breaking
        <span class="chords">    G#                                  F#m    Em</span>
        but inside in the dark I'm aching to be free.
         
        
        [Chorus]
        
        <span class="chords">                 Bm                   G</span>
        The show must go on, the show must go on, yeah,
        <span class="chords">   Em</span>
        inside my heart is breaking
        <span class="chords">   F#</span>
        my make-up may be flaking
        <span class="chords">       Em</span>
        but my smile still stays on. 
        
         
        
        [Interlude]
        
        <span class="chords">Bm   G   Em   F#   Em</span>
        
         
        
        [Bridge]
        
        <span class="chords">   F       G                Em               Am G</span>
        My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
        <span class="chords">F             G              Em              Am</span>
        fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
        <span class="chords">C#m7b5           D</span>
        I can fly - my friends.
         
        
        [Chorus]
        
        <span class="chords">                 Bm                   G</span>
        The show must go on, the show must go on, yeah,
        <span class="chords">     Em</span>
        I'll face it with a grin
        <span class="chords">    F#</span>
        I'm never giving in
        <span class="chords">              Em</span>
        on - with the show.
          
        
        [Solo]
        <span class="chords">Bm G</span>
         
        
        [Outro]
        
        <span class="chords">     Em                 F#</span>
        I'll top the bill, I'll overkill,
        <span class="chords">  F#                             Em</span>
        I have to find the will to carry on.
        <span class="chords">                    Bm</span>
        The show must go on.
